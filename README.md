# Project-ITT-Web-Application

Abstract.
This project addresses the implementation of an electronic system that allows 
transforming a conventional wheelchair into a device that helps disabled people to 
move more comfortably using voice commands and a joystick. In addition to this 
feature, the device has fall detection functions, sending an emergency message to 
people close to the user; a web solution to both track the user and for the user to set 
reminders of interest that he or her has during the day or during a specific period of 
time; obstacle detection that prevents unexpected collisions; and the option for 
autonomous movement of the chair within known environments.
This integration seeks to solve, or alleviate, the whole set of common motor problems 
and impediments that overwhelm disabled people when they want to carry out their 
day-to-day activities. In the same way, it tries to overcome the poor adaptability of 
similar products available in the current market, providing the device with traceability 
and user safety characteristics; providing, as a whole, greater independence to 
convalescents and avoiding excessive fatigue caused by having to push the traditional 
chair with their own effort.
This prototype has its origin in the innovation and reformulation of the classic 
wheelchair, which constitutes a cheaper option than buying any equivalent product, 
even those ones with lesser scope in terms of functions, on the market. This renewal 
process is a competitive advantage that, unlike other implementations, establishes a 
higher quality-price factor for what it offers in usefulness and its acquisition cost, 
supplying the users of these devices with many more functionalities than other 
wheelchairs that are limited to only the electrical component without intelligence in 
between.
